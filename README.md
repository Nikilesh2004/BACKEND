       (SUM(registrations) - LAG(SUM(registrations)) OVER (PARTITION BY category ORDER BY EXTRACT(YEAR FROM reg_date)))
       / LAG(SUM(registrations)) OVER (PARTITION BY category ORDER BY EXTRACT(YEAR FROM reg_date)) * 100 AS yoy_growth
FROM registrations
GROUP BY category, EXTRACT(YEAR FROM reg_date);
```

```sql
SELECT category,
       EXTRACT(YEAR FROM reg_date) AS year,
       EXTRACT(QUARTER FROM reg_date) AS quarter,
